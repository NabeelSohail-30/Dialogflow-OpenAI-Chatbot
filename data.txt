Marvel Studios is an American film studio that is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. Founded in 1993 by Avi Arad and Toy Biz, Marvel Studios is primarily known for producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a shared universe of superhero films based on characters from Marvel Comics. The MCU has become one of the most successful and lucrative franchises in film history, grossing over $22 billion at the global box office.
Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Publications. Over the years, the company would go through a number of name changes, including Atlas Comics and Marvel Comics Group, before settling on Marvel Comics in the 1960s. In the 1960s, Marvel Comics was revolutionized by the work of writer Stan Lee and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, who created a number of iconic characters including Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.
Marvel Comics continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but in the 1990s, the comic book industry as a whole suffered a major downturn. Marvel Comics was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1996, and the company was restructured with the help of investment firm Perelman Partners.
In 1998, Marvel Studios was founded as a subsidiary of Marvel Comics. The studio's first film, Blade, was released in 1998 and was a critical and commercial success. However, it was not until the release of Iron Man in 2008 that Marvel Studios began to truly revolutionize the superhero film genre.
The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a shared universe of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The universe is based on characters from Marvel Comics and is connected through a series of interlocking storylines and shared characters. The MCU has become one of the most successful and lucrative franchises in film history, grossing over $22 billion at the global box office.
By 2005, Marvel Entertainment had begun planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through Paramount Pictures.[1] In June 2007, Marvel Studios raised secured funding from a $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch.[2] Marvel's plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film.[3]

In November 2013, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige said that "in an ideal world" releases each year would include one film based on an existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's "a nice rhythm" in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is "certainly something to aim for".[4] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, "I don't know that we'll keep to [that model] every year, but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, so I think it would be fun to continue that sort of thing".[5] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014,[6] in which some had three films scheduled, Feige stated there was not "a number cruncher" telling the studio to increase their film output, but rather it was about "managing [existing] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going."[7] After the titles were revealed in October 2014,[8] Feige said, "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [in 2017 and 2018] instead of just two, without changing our methods."[9] On the potential for "superhero fatigue", Feige stated, though each of the films are based on the Marvel Comics and feature the "Marvel Studios" logo, he believed each film had their own distinctions to help differentiate them from other MCU and superhero films. For example, he noted how the 2016 releases of the studio, Captain America: Civil War and Doctor Strange, were "two completely different movies". The studio hoped to continue to surprise audiences and ensure the studio was "not falling into things becoming too similar".[10]

In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the "rhythm" that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like "a big event or crossover series",[11] with Avengers films acting as "big, giant linchpins".[12] On expanding the characters in the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outside of Avengers films, Feige stated, it is about "teaching the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. Just like comic readers have been doing for decades and decades ... people sort of are accepting that there's just a time when they should be together and there's a time when they're not."[13]

In April 2016, on moving the universe to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, "I think there will be a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a very different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three Phases." Frequent director Joe Russo added Phase Three was the "deconstruction Phase" of the MCU, beginning with Captain America: Civil War (2016) leading into "the culmination films" of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).[14] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by Phases, saying, "it might be a new thing".[15] Feige mentioned that Avengers: Endgame would provide "a definitive end" to the films and storylines preceding it, with the franchise having "two distinct periods. Everything before [Endgame] and everything after". Many of the planned films following Endgame were intentionally "completely different" from the films in The Infinity Saga.[16]

In July 2019, Feige announced the Phase Four slate at San Diego Comic-Con, consisting of films and television event series on Disney+.[17] In December 2020, at Disney's Investor Day, Marvel Studios provided updates to previously announced films for the Phase.[18][19] In late June 2022, Feige said that as Phase Four was nearing its conclusion, he felt audiences would begin to see where the next saga of the MCU would be heading, and added that there had been many clues throughout the Phase to what that would be. He said Marvel Studios would be a "little more direct" on their future plans in the following months to provide audiences with "the bigger picture [so they] can see a tiny, tiny bit more of the roadmap".[20] In July 2022, Feige unveiled the Phase Five and Six slates at San Diego Comic-Con, similarly consisting of films and Disney+ series, and revealed that these three Phases would make up "the Multiverse Saga".[21]

On how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said in September 2015 there are "broad strokes" though sometime "super-specific things". He continued that there was enough leeway to "have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up" and that each film would feel satisfying on its own, but still interconnected to the larger universe and as if it had been planned years ahead of time. The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with Spider-Man.[22]
The first film in the MCU was Iron Man, released in 2008. The film starred Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist who creates a high-tech suit of armor to become the superhero Iron Man. Iron Man was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $585 million at the global box office.
Following the success of Iron Man, Marvel Studios released a number of other films that would become part of the MCU, including The Incredible Hulk (2008), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and The Avengers (2012). The Avengers brought together a number of the MCU's main characters, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk, and grossed over $1.5 billion at the global box office.
Since the release of The Avengers, the MCU has continued to expand with a number of sequels and spin-off films, including Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Ant-Man (2015), Doctor Strange (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and Black Panther (2018). The MCU has also expanded to television with a number of series produced for the streaming service Disney+, including WandaVision (2021) and The Falcon and The Winter Soldier (2021).
In addition to its films and television series, the MCU has also had a significant impact on popular culture, with its characters and stories inspiring a wide range of merchandise, comic books, and fan communities.
